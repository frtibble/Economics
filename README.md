# Economics

This project looks at exploring data from the [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/ashe1997to2015selectedestimates).

## Getting Started

This repository includes:
* [py-awe.csv](https://github.com/frtibble/Economics/blob/master/py-awe.csv) - the original data for annual estimates of earnings and paid hours worked by UK employees using ASHE data from 1997 to 2018.
* [pysalarydata.csv](https://github.com/frtibble/Economics/blob/master/pysalarydata.csv) - a reformatted and reduced version of the file for the purposes of the exercise.
* [Exercise D.ipynb](https://github.com/frtibble/Economics/blob/master/Exercise%20D.ipynb) - the exercise.
* [Exercise D - Solution.ipynb](https://github.com/frtibble/Economics/blob/master/Exercise%20D%20-%20Solution.ipynb) - a sample solution.
